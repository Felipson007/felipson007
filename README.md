Hello there! I'm Felipe Silva de Souza, a Full Stack Developer with over 4 years of experience specializing in building scalable web solutions.


My expertise lies in a range of modern technologies, including backend development with Java (Spring Boot) and Node.js. On the frontend, I work with Vue.js and React, and I'm skilled in using TypeScript. I also have a strong foundation in databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.



I am passionate about implementing best practices such as Clean Code and Unit Tests, and I'm experienced in agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban. I also work with tools like Docker and Git and am familiar with CI/CD practices.





Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my work, including a task management system built with Node.js and React, and an AI automation project using n8n. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to contribute to high-impact projects in a collaborative environment.
